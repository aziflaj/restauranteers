# Restauranteers

_Homeworks can be fun_ :smiley:

Restauranteers is a final project developed for the Software Engineering course in the Polytechnic University of Tirana. The application shows a list of restaurants (including their menus) and allows users write reviews about them.

The application is built using a full-stack JavaScript solution:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) for the database
- [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/), a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) framework for the back-end logic
- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) in the front
